#### Brief Description of Project - 

The Sysro Tuition Management System is a highly sophisticated and user-friendly web-based
application designed to streamline and automate the processes involved in managing a tuition
center. The system offers separate, tailored dashboards for each of the major stakeholders
involved in the center, including the administrator, teacher, student and parent as well as separate
portals for managing attendance, exams and expenses.

The Tuition Management System is designed to enhance the overall efficiency and security of the
center's operations while reducing manual effort and increasing accuracy and reliability of
information. The system is a centralized solution that will save time, increase transparency, and
improve the overall management of the tuition center
