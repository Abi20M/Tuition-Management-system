#### Brief Description of Project -

The Sysro Tuition Management System is a highly sophisticated and user-friendly web-based application designed to streamline and automate the processes involved in managing a tuition center. The system offers separate, tailored dashboards for each of the major stakeholders involved in the center, including the administrator, teacher, student and parent as well as separate portals for managing attendance, exams and expenses.

The Tuition Management System is designed to enhance the overall efficiency and security of the center's operations while reducing manual effort and increasing accuracy and reliability of information. The system is a centralized solution that will save time, increase transparency, and improve the overall management of the tuition center.

#### Technologies used -

Sysro Tuition Management System include the MERN stack, which is comprised of MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. These technologies are known for their scalability, flexibility, and robustness, making them the ideal choice for developing a web-based application of this nature. Here is a breakdown of each technology in the MERN stack:

| Technology | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| MongoDB | A NoSQL database used to store and manage data in a highly scalable and flexible manner |
| Express.js | A backend web application framework that provides features and functionalities for developing web applications with Node js |
| React | A JavaScript library used for building interactive user interfaces and web applications |
| Node.js | A server-side runtime environment that enables the development of scalable and high-performance applications with JavaScript |
